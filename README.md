## Installation
    
For this project you will need to install inquirer by inputing npm i inquirer
    
## Usage
    
![README Generator Gif](/images-and-gifs/readmeGif.gif) This project uses inquirer to create a professional README. You will need to use node.js to run this application. The prompts also utilize the validate feature to require the user to create inputs of at least three characters long. I also developed this generator with open source in mind so many of the prompts/confirms are related to it being open source. The only major constraint to this project is that you will need to add your own gifs and images after creating the README. An example of a readme generated by this program can be seen below (you can also click the image to view the video tutorial).
